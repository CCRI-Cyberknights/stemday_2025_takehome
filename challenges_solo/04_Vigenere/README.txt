# 🧩 Vigenère Cipher Challenge

You’ve recovered a scrambled message from an intercepted communication. Analysts suspect it was encoded using the Vigenère cipher — a classic encryption method that scrambles letters based on a repeating keyword.

## 🧠 What is the Vigenère Cipher?

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a repeating keyword. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by an amount determined by the corresponding letter in the keyword.

For example:  
- Plaintext: ATTACK  
- Keyword:   KEYKEY  
- Ciphertext: KXRIGU  

This was considered strong in the 16th century, but modern tools can break it.

## 🛠 Tools You Might Use

Linux and open-source software provide ways to decode a Vigenère cipher:  

- gpg or cryptool (if available) – some cipher-breaking tools include Vigenère support.  
- python – you can write a small script to try a keyword.  
- online Vigenère decoders – useful but take care with uploading data.  

This challenge assumes you’ll explore and choose the right approach for decoding.

## 📝 Challenge Instructions

1. Open cipher.txt and inspect the encrypted message.  
2. Try to decode it using the suspected keyword.  

Hint: What is our state capital? That word might help unlock the message.

3. Look carefully at each decoded result. Only one will contain a flag in the correct format.

Note: Some tools might print the decoded result on screen without saving it. If you see the flag, save it yourself:  

echo "CCRI-AAAA-1111" > decoded_output.txt

- cipher.txt – The encrypted message.

## 🏁 Flag Format

When you find the flag, it will look like this:

CCRI-AAAA-1111

Replace the AAAA and numbers with the real code you uncover.

Take your time and experiment. This challenge is about understanding how classical ciphers work and how they can be broken.
