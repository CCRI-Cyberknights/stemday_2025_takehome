# 🐍 Challenge 09: Fix the Flag!

You’ve found a Python script that’s supposed to reveal the cryptkeeper’s flag — but it’s broken!

Instead of showing the correct flag, it prints the wrong number at the end. Your task is to debug and repair the code so the full flag is revealed.

Even small mistakes in code can have big consequences. This script has a bug that causes it to calculate the wrong value. You’ll need to identify the issue and fix it like a proper developer would.

Think like a coder. Follow the flow of logic. One wrong operator is all that stands between you and the flag!

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

| Tool / Command  | Purpose                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `nano` / `vim`  | Edit the Python script in the terminal         |
| `python`        | Run the script and see what it prints          |
| `print()`       | Add extra output to help debug variable values |
| `int()` / `f""` | Convert values and format output cleanly       |

> 💡 **Tip:** Pay special attention to how the code performs calculations.

## 📝 Objectives

1. Open `broken_flag.py` and carefully review the code.
2. Look for logic or math errors in how the final number is calculated.
3. Correct the mistake and re-run the script to reveal the proper flag.
