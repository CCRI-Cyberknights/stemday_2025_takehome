# 🧩 Base64 Decode Challenge

📡 **Intercepted Transmission**  
An encoded message has been intercepted from a compromised CryptKeeper system.  

The file `encoded.txt` contains an entire transmission that has been obfuscated using **Base64**, a common encoding scheme designed to safely transport data across text-only channels.  

---

🔧 **Base64 isn’t encryption**  
It’s just a way of encoding data. Anyone with the right tool can reverse it.  

💡 **Hint:** Once decoded, review the transmission carefully. It contains several flag candidates — but only one matches the agency’s official format.

## 📂 Files in this folder:
- `encoded.txt` – The intercepted Base64-encoded transmission.
- `decode_base64.sh` – A helper script to guide you through decoding.
- (The decoded result will be saved as `decoded_output.txt`.)

🏁 **Flag format:** `CCRI-AAAA-1111`
